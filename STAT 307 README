# Statistical Design README
This project was worked on in collaboration with Angelos Vasilopoulos.
Goal of this project was to determine if there was a difference or change in political ideology amongst college students as they matured through the college experience.
Main two factors that we obsereved were the individual's grade level and sex.


Population consisted of LUC students that were on campus
Data collection occurred in the Damen Student Center, on Tuesday and Thursday from 11:30 A.M. till 2:20 P.M.

Randomization occurred at 2 stages of the study:
Subject selection: individuals would be randomly approached in the Damen student center 
Avoided taking multiple samples from potential friend groups as this could break independence
Observations were live subjects; had to be respectful of an individual’s wish to not take the survey

Replicate selection: from the pool of available replicates, 3 were randomly selected for each paired level of sex and grade level
Factorial calls for CRD randomization across the entire experiment
Randomly chose replicate for each sex and grade (similar to blocking randomization)
Even number of replicates, but uneven replicate pools due to sampling 


Equation form: yijk = µ + τi + βj + (τβ)ij + εijk
µ = overall effect, τ = grade level at i’th level, β = sex at j’th level, e = error at i and j’th level of the k’th replicate
i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5	|	j = 1, 2	|	k = 1, 2, 3
Assumptions: 
2 fixed effects; sum of these effects and interaction is 0
Normality and constant variance within the error term
Normal, Homoscedastic, I.I.D. 
Response y:
Score: an individual’s level of conservatism as a whole
Inverted the individual scores of abortion, immigration, welfare benefits, tax, etc…
X -> (110 - X)
Average of the individuals’ scores 


Since sex was significant; also subsetted to see how it compared for each year; was significant at every year EXCEPT for grad students
Due to lower sampling pool for graduate students.

We also created a penalized regression model that would do variable selection on the interactions of the base variables and the additional variables
Allows the user to estimate an individual’s score given a set of information (for example, a person’s sex and their view of abortion) 
Used Polyserial and Biserial correlations to obtain initial variables.


With variables GPA, major, and location included, the following effects are significant:
Sex
Year
Location (marginally)
Interaction of sex and religion
As expected, most score components significantly affected mean ideology score
Welfare benefits, while strongly correlated with sex, did not signficialty affect mean ideology score
Interestingly, although abortion and sex were relatively strongly correlated, their interaction did not significantly affect mean ideology score


Conclusions:
Sex was a relevant indicator in explaining the average score of an individual while the year of the individual was not
It many cases, it appears that men are on average more conservative than women
When other variables are included in the model, other variables that previously weren’t significant became significant
