*based on results in the GBR, men held more % gold and silver medals than women
while women held more bronze, also chi square was sign at a=0.05 for women but not men
meaning that womens data deviated from expected significantly, most suspect is the 
difference in the expected gold and bronze% for women with too little gold and too
high bronze;
